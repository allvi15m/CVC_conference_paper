\begin{enumerate}
%1
\item \textbf{Get nodes effected:} When a voltage violation is detected. The algorithm starts by receiving the location of the affected nodes.
%2
\item \textbf{Determine node with highest voltage deviation.}
%3
\item \textbf{Construct system jacobian matrix}
%4
\item \textbf{Calculate Sensitivity matrix}
%5
\item \textbf{Calculate electrical distances}
%6
\item \textbf{Order the nodes:} In this step the nodes capable of providing reactive power support are ordered according to their electrical distance from the selected effected node. The ordered list of nodes is saved in a list called \textit{Node\_list}
%7
\item \textbf{Apply the appropriate reactive power:} In this step the first node in the \textit{Node\_list} is selected. If the node has the capability to supply the required reactive power determined by the sensitivity matrix the algorithm sets the node to provide the required amount of power and continues to \textbf{step 9}. Otherwise the algorithm sets the node to deliver the maximum available reactive power and takes it out of the list of nodes capable of providing reactive power.
%8
\item \textbf{Repeat steps 3 to 7}
%9
\item \textbf{Request the devices at the nodes to apply calculated changes}
